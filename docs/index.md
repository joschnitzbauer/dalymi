# dalymi

*[data like you mean it]*  
A lightweight, data-focused and non-opinionated pipeline manager written in and for Python.

---

*dalymi* allows to build data processing pipelines as [directed acyclic graphs]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph]) (DAGs).  
DAG nodes (or "tasks") are vanilla Python functions with a certain call signature and decorators to specify task dependencies. Task dependencies (DAG edges) are defined implicitly by specifying interim data as inputs and outputs of tasks. Hence, tasks are only executed after input data has been generated by upstream tasks.

*dalymi* aims for rapid prototyping and minimal setup for data-processing projects.  
Several features facilitate this goal:

- simple, non-opinionated API (most choices left to user)
- no external dependencies for pipeline execution
- one-line installation
- no configuration
- auto-generated command line interface for pipeline execution
- DAG visualization using [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
- API design encourages good development practices (modular code, defined data schemas, code-inherent docs, easy workflow viz, etc.)


## Installation
```
pip install dalymi
```

For the latest development:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/joschnitzbauer/dalymi.git
```

DAG visualization requires [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/).
